- Command line interfaces (Linux/Unix and Windows)
- Network Address Translation (NAT)
- Source code version control (Git)
- Local virtual machines
- Docker containers
- Connecting to ITELL

## Command Line Interfaces

Command Line Interface's (CLI's\Terminals\Consoles) are used heavily in system administration. We'll remotely interact with a number of text based interfaces to administer networked systems throughout this course; please be sure you are familiar with the local consoles for Linux and Windows computers.

### Linux/Unix Shell

- [Introduction to Bash](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/intro-to-bash)
- [Learning the Shell](http://linuxcommand.org/lc3_learning_the_shell.php)

### Windows PowerShell

- [Introduction to PowerShell](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/intro-to-powershell)

## Network Address Translation (NAT)

Understanding how public and private networks interact will help frame a number of the technological and managment hurdles we'll discuss when administering cloud systems.

Here are a few great resources explaining NAT:
- [HowStuffWorks](https://computer.howstuffworks.com/nat.htm)
- [Cisco NAT](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/network-address-translation-nat/26704-nat-faq-00.html)
- [NAT on Linux](https://www.karlrupp.net/en/computer/nat_tutorial)

## Git Version-Control Management

We'll be leveraging open source software throughout this course. It is really important to understand how software engineers and technical managers use to manage the development and change of code bases. Understanding source control pratices will give you a greater understanding of automation techniques\workflows as we discusses them.

Here are a few great resources to learn Git:

- [Pro Git Book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2)
- [Git Handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/)
- [Hands on Labs](https://www.katacoda.com/courses/git)
- [Cheat Sheet](https://services.github.com/on-demand/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet/)

## Virtualization

Understanding the basics of virtualization and what it means to run virtual machines and containers on your laptop will greatly help you throughout this course as we dive into managing cloud systems and resources.

- [Understanding Virtualization](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/virtualization)
- [Virtualization Essentials](https://www.vmware.com/content/dam/digitalmarketing/vmware/en/pdf/ebook/gated-vmw-ebook-virtualization-essentials.pdf)
- [What are containers?](https://www.cio.com/article/2924995/software/what-are-containers-and-why-do-you-need-them.html)

### Local Virtual Machines How-To's

It is recommended that you understand how to create a virtual machine on your laptop. I would recommend creating an Ubuntu 18.04 Desktop VM to ensure you are familiar with the Bash shell. Mac users may want to additionaly create a Windows VM to learn PowerShell.

- VMware Workstation (Windows) or Fusion (Mac) can be acquired for free by logging into [my.ischool.syr.edu](https://my.ischool.syr.edu/), then navigating to 'Download Software', then clicking on the VMware logo.
- [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) is an OpenSource alternative for running local VM's

### Local Docker Containers How-To's

A basic understanding of how developers develop, deploy and run software in containers will give you a head start on a number of topics we'll discuss this semester.

## Connecting to the ITELL environment

The iSchool maintains a private cloud, leveraging VMware solutions, to host virtual machines for curricular use. Each student will be provisioned virtual machines which can be used to practice skills and concepts throughout the semester.

Instructions on how to access the ITELL environment from the iSchool labs can be [found here](https://answers.syr.edu/x/coENB).
