## Learning Objective <!-- omit in toc -->

To garner a deeper understanding of container-based virtualization, the services required to effectively deploy a two tier application using kubernetes\minikube, and to sharpen your basic systems administration skills.

In this lab you will:

- create a test\dev Kubernetes cluster
- create persistent volumes and claims
- use a kubernetes secret object
- deploy a two tier application
- clean up your mess!

## Lab Research: Readings and Videos

Prior to starting this exercise, it is recommended that you familiarize yourself with the technologies we'll be using:

- [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/what-is-kubernetes/)
  - [Interactive Kubernetes Tutorials](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/)
  - [5 minute video explainer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PH-2FfFD2PU)
  - We'll be using [Minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/minikube/)
  - [Cheat Sheet](https://www.cheatography.com/nighthawk/cheat-sheets/kubectl/)

### Lab Notes

Within the [ITELL environment](https://answers.syr.edu/x/ZwL-Aw) you will find an Ubuntu Server virtual machine and an Windows 10 virtual machine. The Ubuntu VM is a basic terminal only installation of Ubuntu Server and the Windows 10 installation is a basic installation of Windows 10, with Docker pre-installed.

>Docker takes a minute to get up and running. Before starting any Docker related activities, ensure that the Docker service is running.

## Lab Task List

- [ ] Setup Minikube in the Ubuntu Server
  - [ ] Access the Minikube web [dashboard](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/web-ui-dashboard/)
- [ ] Create a [Secret](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/) to use with our database
- [ ] Deploy a mySQL database using [this base configuration](https://github.com/dirtyredbeard/IST643/blob/master/KubernetesLabs/mysql-deployment.yaml)
  - [ ] Tweak the configuration to work with your Secret
- [ ] Verify the configuration took
  - [ ] The PersistentVolume was created?
  - [ ] The Pods are running?
- [ ] Deploy a Wordpress application as a Service using [this base configuration](https://github.com/dirtyredbeard/IST643/blob/master/KubernetesLabs/wordpress-deployment.yaml)
  - [ ] Tweak the configuration to work with your Secret
  - [ ] Verify the configuration took
  - [ ] The PersistentVolume was bound?
  - [ ] The Service is running?
  >  Minikube can only expose Services through NodePort. The EXTERNAL-IP is always pending.
  >
  > To configure Wordpress, find the IP, run: ` minikube service wordpress --url`
  - [ ] Get Wordpress up and running!
- [ ] Tear down your lab
  - [ ] Delete your secret
  - [ ] Delete your deployment
  - [ ] Delete your service
  - [ ] Delete your PersistentVolumeClaim
