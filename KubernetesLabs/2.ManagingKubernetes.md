# Container Management Lab <!-- omit in toc -->

> Estimated Completion Time: 10-15 Hours
>
> Due Date: You should have an understanding of these concepts by the end of week 3.

## Learning Objective <!-- omit in toc -->

To garner a deeper understanding of container-based virtualization, the services required to effectively offer a container hosing service\platform, and to sharpen your basic systems administration skills.

In this lab you will:

- create a test\dev Kubernetes cluster
- setup and configure a Kubernetes management platform
- begin exploring day-to-day administration\capabilities\implications of these platforms
- deploy your first basic workload

## Lab Research: Readings and Videos

Prior to starting this exercise, it is recommended that you familiarize yourself with the technologies we'll be using:

- Kubernetes deep dive videos
    - [Understanding Kubernetes, Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuWSY_fwV6M)
    - [Understanding Kubernetes, Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3ExWruji7g)
    - [Understanding Kubernetes, Part 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrtvGHwyza0)
  - We'll be using [Minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/minikube/) 
- [Rancher](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/overview/)
  - [Technical Architecture](https://info.rancher.com/hubfs/eBooks/Rancher%20Architecture%20-%20v2.1.pdf)
  - [Deploy Rancher via Docker](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/quick-start-guide/deployment/quickstart-manual-setup/)

## Lab Exercise

Now that you have thoroughly researched the technologies and have a fundamental understanding of the problems which Kubernetes and Rancher solve...

Lets set up the a test environment to get some experiential knowledge!

### Lab Notes

Within the [ITELL environment](https://answers.syr.edu/x/ZwL-Aw) you will find an Ubuntu Server virtual machine and an Windows 10 virtual machine. The Ubuntu VM is a basic terminal only installation of Ubuntu Server and the Windows 10 installation is a basic installation of Windows 10, with Docker pre-installed.

>Docker takes a minute to get up and running. Before starting any Docker related activities, ensure that the Docker service is running.

## Lab Task List

Now that you understand Kubernetes and Rancher, lets set up a Minikube cluster in the Ubuntu Server VM. Once Minikube is configured, deploy the Rancher Kubernetes Management Platform in a Docker container on Windows to manage the cluster. Then lets poke around Rancher and do some administrative tasks.

Below is a list of tasks to guide your efforts:

- [ ] Setup Minikube in the Ubuntu Server
- [ ] Setup rancher within a docker container on Windows
- [ ] Configure Rancher to manage the Minikube cluster
- [ ] Create a Rancher project
  - [ ] Create a longhorn persistent storage volume for the project
  - [ ] Create three local users
  - [ ]  Assign them to the project
  - [ ]  Assign them different resource quotas
- [ ]  Deploy an Ubuntu workload within your project
  - [ ]  Connect to it!
- [ ]  Use kubectl to list all running containers in Minikube

## Questions

After completing this lab you should be able to answer the following questions:

1. Describe the following Kubernetes\Rancher terms:
   - A. Container
   - Node
   - Pod
   - Cluster
   - Deployment
   - Kubectl
   - Rancher Cluster Agent
   - Rancher Node Agent
   - Workload
2. How many nodes can Rancher scale to?
3. In Rancher, what types of workloads are there? Describe them.
4. What is a persistent volume?
