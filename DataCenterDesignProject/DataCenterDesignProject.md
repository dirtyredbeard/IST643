## Learning Objectives <!-- omit in toc -->

This is a research project intended for you to critically think about managing the design, implementation, and maintenance of an on-premise computing cluster. Specifically for you to:

- State assumptions made throughout (How\why did you draw these conclusions?)
- Create a Network topology for your design
- Derive equipment and associated costs from your design
- Analyze and recommend a virtualization platform and its associated costs
- Estimate the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) of your design
- Estimate the Return On Investment (ROI) of your design

## Scenario

You're an IT management team at a rapidly growing regional for profit technical college.

You have an IT staff trained in maintaining the college network and administering workstations.

Each student is assigned a desktop costing $1,300. Replaced every 4 years.

It has been previously determined that to complete coursework the average student utilized their computing environment for 15 hours\week.

The student population is currently 650.

Students pays a lab fee of $250 per term.

## Task

dean: gift of data center floor space...need proposal of costs to virtualize current environment...growing X% year/year...pitch a plan

## Required Deliverable's

- 10 Slide PowerPoint Presentation
- Network topology design file (Microsoft Visio, [Draw.io](https://www.draw.io/), or [Creately](https://creately.com/) recommended)
- Data Center Cost Breakdown file
