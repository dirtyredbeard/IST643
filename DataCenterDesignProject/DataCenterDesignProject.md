## Learning Objectives <!-- omit in toc -->

This is a research project intended for you to critically think about managing the design, implementation, and maintenance of an on-premise computing cluster. Specifically for you to:

- State assumptions made throughout (How\why did you draw these conclusions?)
- Create a Network topology for your design
- Derive equipment and associated costs from your design
- Analyze and recommend a virtualization platform and its associated costs
- Estimate the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) of your design
- Estimate the Return On Investment (ROI) of your design

## Scenario / Given Assumptions

- You're an IT management team at a rapidly growing regional for profit technical college.
- You have an IT staff trained in maintaining the college network and administering workstations.
- Each student is assigned a desktop costing $1,300.
- College IT policy is to decommission computing hardware after 4 years.
- Desktops are equipped with 4 core CPU's, 32gb of RAM, and 256gb SSD's.
- It has been previously determined that to complete coursework the average student utilized their computing environment for 15 hours\week.
- The student population is currently 650.
- Students pays a lab fee of $250 per term.
- Student population is growing 3% year to year
- The college has purchasing agreements with Dell, 25% off web pricing.

## The Assignment

College administrators have notified you that a grant has been awarded to the college -- floor space in a local data center. The grant will cover all power, cooling, and network up-link costs for 8 years. The data center will provide 220v power connections to racks and two 10gbe network up-links to one rack.

We are required to tell the data center operators the following:

- An estimated cooling requirement
- An estimated power draw for our equipment (in amps)
- The number of equipment racks required

The college administration is entertaining proposals for how to best use the space. Your CIO would like to propose virtualizing our lab environment --instead of providing physical desktops to students. The CIO has asked you to prepare a presentation and document outlying:

- Any assumptions made throughout,
- A viable solution,
- Associated costs,
- Your recommendation (Is this feasible?),
- The information requested by the data center,
- ROI,
- TCO,
- Additional relevant information.

## Required Deliverable's

- 10 Slide PowerPoint Presentation, citing references
- Network topology design file (Microsoft Visio, [Draw.io](https://www.draw.io/), or [Creately](https://creately.com/) recommended)
- Data Center Cost Breakdown file (Excel)
- Executive Summary, outlining your findings and citing references
